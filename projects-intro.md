## Some coding projects of mine

I currently work as a full-stack Software Developer at <a href="https://www.futurice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Futurice</a> providing digital solutions to business needs for our customers.

Here are some of my personal, uncommercial projects. Most of them are made with JavaScript (React, Node) and hosted on Heroku or GitHub Pages.

Check out my <a href="https://github.com/anttispitkanen" target="_blank">GitHub profile</a> for the code.
