## Some coding projects of mine

I'm all for JavaScript (and TypeScript). I mostly do front-end stuff with React and Redux and APIs with Node. 

These are some of my personal, uncommercial projects. Most of them are hosted on Heroku.

Check out my <a href="https://github.com/anttispitkanen" target="_blank">GitHub</a> profile for the code.
