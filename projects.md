### anttipitkanen.com

This website is built with Create React App and hosted statically on GitHub pages. What makes it a bit different is that is uses another GitHub repo for managing all the text and image content. See the source for more info.

### CrowdMill (Junction 2017)

I attended <a href="https://hackjunction.com/" target="_blank">Junction</a> (the biggest hackathon in Europe) in 2017. Our team built an app for facial detection from video that can be used i.e. to count and monitor the movement of people in public spaces such as malls or on public transportation. My role was to implement the front-end business logic for the demo in React and Redux. It was a lot of fun to work with a talented team on an interesting project.
