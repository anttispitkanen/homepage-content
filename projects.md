### UTA course calendar

I study at University of Tampere and got tired of having to write my courses in my calendar by hand. So, using the University of Tampere open data API, I built an app that automates it. Now any student at UTA can copy the course URL from the official schedules, paste it in this app and click to create their own study calendar.

### Pitch KaraokES

At <a href="http://tampere.es" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tampere ES</a> we do a lot of pitching. To help practice, I built a Pitch KaraokES game where you can practice pitching with either Quick Fire pitching or Karaoke pitching. Try it, it's fun! What's technically interesting is that it's a SPA hosted on GitHub Pages with reload-enabled client side routing. You can dig into the source code to see more about that.

### Y-bus

A website that uses the Tampere open public transportation API to display current bus schedule information between the three universities in Tampere.

### anttipitkanen.com

This website is built with Create React App and hosted statically on GitHub pages. What makes it a bit different is that is uses another GitHub repo for managing all the text and image content. See the source for more info.

### CrowdMill (Junction 2017)

I attended <a href="https://hackjunction.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Junction</a> (the biggest hackathon in Europe) in 2017. Our team built an app for facial detection from video that can be used i.e. to count and monitor the movement of people in public spaces such as malls or on public transportation. My role was to implement the front-end business logic for the demo in React and Redux. It was a lot of fun to work with a talented team on an interesting project.
