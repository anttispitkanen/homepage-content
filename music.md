### Poetkoe

I write, play and produce my own music under the alias <a href="https://poetkoe.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Poetkoe</a>. The genres range from rock to rap and electronica to house.

In 2016 I made the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEhKRjrar6I" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official anthem</a> for the basketball team Ponteva from my old home town Hyvinkää.

### Solo & Band

I have sung and played guitar, bass and keys on gigs both solo and with a band for years.

What I find most interesting about playing live is improvisation: the need to stay focused and ready to adapt to changing situations. A request from the audience can take the whole show to a new direction.

Playing with a group of people is the ultimate form of teamwork and communication, and playing with new people is always different and exciting.
