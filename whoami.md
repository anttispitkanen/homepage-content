## Who am I?

Software Developer at Futurice, an eager Public Speaker, Competence coach, musician, former Chairperson at Tribe Tampere, former Tampere ES Vice President, former Y-kampus Student Activator, event organizer, lazy blogger, Computer Science student, BBA, and, I've been told, a decently nice guy from Tampere, Finland.
