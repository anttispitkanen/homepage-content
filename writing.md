Occasionally I think of something that I think is worth writing down and sharing to people. Such topics are, for example, <a href="https://medium.com/tribes-stories/how-i-failed-my-education-and-how-you-can-avoid-doing-the-same-153338473ada" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how I failed my education</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/tribes-stories/tamperejs-a-community-for-web-developers-4a337a9895ae" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">why having a community of JavaScript enthusiasts is cool</a>.
