### Tampere Entrepreneurship Society

<a href="http://www.tampere.es/" target="_blank">Tampere ES</a> is a non-profit, student-led open community where diverse people can meet and create their personal network in real life. We focus on infecting students with the entrepreneurial attitude, getting them into the bigger entrepreneurial ecosystem and supporting them in the process. We also keep good connections to the other Entrepreneurship Societies in Finland, opening opportunities on a national level.

### Tribe Tampere

<a href="https://tribetampere.com/" target="_blank">Tribe Tampere</a> is an open community consisting of people dedicated to serve the Tampere startup and entrepreneurial ecosystem. Tribe operates as a platform. It means creating value for organizations and individuals by making it easier for them to connect with each other in a meaningful way. One way of saying it is it empowers those who try to help others achieve their dreams.

Several big projects have been done through Tribe Tampere, the biggest of which are Startup World Cup Finland 2018 and the TribeX event series.

### Startup Weekend Tampere

We brought <a href="https://startupweekend.org/" target="_blank">Startup Weekend</a> to Tampere for the first time in March 2018 with an international volunteer team. My role in the organizer team was in marketing, handling social media accounts, doing F2F promotion and handling ticket saled and registrations. During the event I took care of attendee communications, pitching feedback to the teams, running the tech, running the social media accounts, and whatever was needed at any given time.

I could not be more satisfied with how the event turned out and the feedback given by attendees, coaches, judges and sponsors. The team was by far the greatest team I've ever been involved in, much kudos and praise to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elisalukin/" target="_blank">Elisa</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/darynabarsukova/" target="_blank">Daryna</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ainosiiroinen/" target="_blank">Aino</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandraengstromsantos/" target="_blank">Alexandra</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anna-pilch/" target="_blank">Anna</a>.

### Y-kampus

<a href="http://y-kampus.fi" target="_blank">Y-kampus</a> is the entrepreneurship and innovation services at Tampere3 universities. I worked at Y-kampus as a Network Facilitator organizing and hosting events for students and businesses, developing new forms of learning, sparring students with their business ideas and coaching students and staff, all with my awesome colleagues. New excellent Student Activators have since continued from where we left, and I have the pleasure to mentor and coach them in their work when needed.

### TampereJS

<a href="https://meetabit.com/communities/tamperejs" target="_blank">TampereJS</a> is a community that organizes monthly JavaScript related meetups in Tampere. My role as an organizer is to get sponsors for the events, do marketing, act as an MC at the events and make sure that everything runs smoothly.

I've been a part of the team since the fall of 2016 and have since given a few talks myself.
