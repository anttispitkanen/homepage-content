### Y-kampus

<a href="http://y-kampus.fi" target="_blank">Y-kampus</a> is the entrepreneurship and innovation services at Tampere3 universities. I work at Y-kampus as a Network Facilitator organizing and hosting events for students and businesses, developing new forms of learning and sparring students with their business ideas.

### Tribe Tampere

<a href="" target="_blank">Tribe Tampere</a> is an open community consisting of people dedicated to serve the Tampere startup and entrepreneurial ecosystem. Tribe operates as a platform. It means creating value for organizations and individuals by making it easier for them to connect with each other in a meaningful way. One way of saying it is it empowers those who try to help others achieve their dreams.

I'm a board member at Tribe Tampere as the representative of Y-kampus. I'm also involved in several projects and generally developing the ecosystem.

### TampereJS

<a href="https://meetabit.com/communities/tamperejs" target="_blank">TampereJS</a> is a community that organizes monthly JavaScript related meetups in Tampere. My role as an organizer is to get sponsors for the events, do marketing, act as an MC at the events and make sure that everything runs smoothly.

I've been a part of the team since the fall of 2016 and have since given a few talks myself.
