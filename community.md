One way of saying it is it empowers those who try to help others achieve their dreams.

I'm a board member at Tribe Tampere as the representative of Y-kampus. I'm also involved in several projects and generally developing the ecosystem.

My role as an organizer is to get sponsors for the events, do marketing, act as an MC at the events and make sure that everything runs smoothly.
